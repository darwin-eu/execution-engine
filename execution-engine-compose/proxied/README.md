EXECUTION ENGINE RUNNING OVER HTTP(S)
=====================================

Here you can find a compose file to easily run the execution engine on a dedicated machine and access over HTTP(S)

Follow the same steps as in the README in the root folder to run execution engine on port 80 (HTTP)

If you want to run on port 443 (HTTPS) you must add your certificate, check the commented out configurations in compose.yaml and
nginx.conf for a suggestion on how to enable this.
